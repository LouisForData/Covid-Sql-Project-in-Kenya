**Introduction**

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact globally. This project uses SQL to analyze COVID-19 data, helping to uncover trends, correlations, and patterns that could be useful for researchers, public health officials, and the general public.
Prerequisites

Before running the SQL scripts, ensure you have the following software installed:

    A SQL database management system (DBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite.
    Basic understanding of SQL.

**Installation**

   1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
      [git clone https://github.com/LouisForData/covid-project.git](https://github.com/LouisForData/Covid-Sql-Project-in-Kenya/blob/main/CovidProject.sql)
      cd covid-project
   2. Set up your SQL environment. If you're using MySQL or PostgreSQL, create a new database:
      CREATE DATABASE covid_analysis;
      Load the data into your database. Run the SQL scripts in the correct order to set up the necessary tables and import data.
## Usage

   1. Connect to your SQL database using your preferred DBMS.

   2. Execute the SQL scripts to perform the analysis. For example:

      source CovidProject.sql;
  3. Explore the results using SQL queries, or export the results for further analysis in tools like Excel or Tableau.
